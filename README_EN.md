# üìö EnglishLearningDaily

Welcome to my daily English learning repository! This repository is designed to help me improve my English skills by learning new words, grammar rules, and expressions every day.

## üìà Daily Learning Progress

I will use this section to record my daily learning progress, including the number of words learned, example sentences, and related vocabulary, among other knowledge points. Through this record, I can track my learning journey and make continuous improvements.

## üìñ Vocabulary Learning

In this section, I will create individual `Markdown` files to document various words. Each word's file typically includes the following information:

- **Word**: The word itself.
- **Definition**: The meaning of the word.
- **Example Sentences**: Sentences containing the word.
- **Phrases**: Some phrases and idiomatic expressions.
- **Related Words**: Synonyms, antonyms, and associated words.
